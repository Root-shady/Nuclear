Hamming distance
    The hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different.
    [categorial or binary data]

    The kNN algorithm is belongs to the family of instance-based, competitive learning and lazy learning algorithm.
    Instance baed algorithm are those algorithms the model the problem using data instances in order to make predictive decisions.
    kNN algorithm internally uses competition between model element in order to make a predictive decision.
    Lazy learning refers to the

1. Collaborative Filtering
    A collaborative filtering algorithm usually works by searching a large group of people and finding a smaller set with tastes similar to yours.
    (1). Collecting References
    A.  Concert tickets 
        Bought      1
        Didn't buy  0

    B.  Online shopping
        Bought      2
        Browsed     1
        Didn't Buy  0

    C. Site Recommender
        Liked       1
        No vote     0
        Dislike     -1
    (Similarity Score: Euclidean distance and Pearson correlation)

2. Person Correlation Score
    The correlation coefficient is a measure of how well two sets of data fit on a straight line.
    One of the benifits is that it corrects for grade inflation. 
 The Personal product-moment correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength of a linear association between two variables and is denoted by r.(r indicates how far away all these data points are to this line of best fit.)
    The stronger the association of two variables, the closer the Person corelation coefficient, r, will be to either +1, or -1 depending on whther the relationship is positive or negative, respectively.

3. which Similarity Metric to use
    Choose the metrics for comparing items:
        (1). Euclidean distance
        (2). Pearson correlation coefficient
        (3). Jaccard coefficient
        (4). Manhattan distance

4. Recommending Items
    A person who is similar to me will contribute more to the overall scre than a person who is different from me. 
    A movie reviewed by more people would have a big advantage, to correct this, you need to divide by the sum of all the similarities for critics that reviewed that movies.

5. Matching Products
    It's not always clear that flipping people and items will lead to useful results, but in many case it will allow you to make interesting comparisons.

What is Deep Learning?
    Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called artifical neural networks.

Andrew Ng:
    Deep Learning, Self-Taught Learning and Unsupervised Feature Learning.
    Using brain silulations:
        (1). Make learning algorithm much better and easier to use
        (2). Make revolutionary advances in machine learning and AI
    (Almost all the value today of deep learning is through supervised learning or learning from labeled data)
  When you hear the term deep learning, just think of a large deep neural net. Deep refers to the number of layers typically and so this kind of the popular term that's been adopted in the press. I think of them as deep neural networks generally.
  (More data + Bigger models + More computation)

Deep learning algorithm seek to exploit the unknow structure in the input distribution in order to discover good representations, often at multiple levels, with higher-level learned features defined in terms of low-level feature.

    The hierarchy of concept allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones. If we draw a graph showing how these concepts are built on top of each other, the graph is deep, with many layers. For this reason, we call this approach to AI deep learning.

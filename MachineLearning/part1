    Introduction to Collective Intelligence
Drew Conclusions and created new business opportunities by using sophisticated algorithms to combine data collected from many different people. 

1. What is collective intelligence
    Building new conclusions from independent contributors.
 
 2. What is machine learning?
    Machine learning is a subfield of artifical intelligence concerned with algorithm that allow computers to learn. 
    All nonrandom data contains patterns, and these patterns allow the machine to generalize. In order to generalize, it trains a model with what it determines are the important aspects of the data.

3. Limit of machine learning
    The algorithms vary in ability to generalize over large sets of patterns, and a pattern is unlikely any seen by the algorithm before is quite likely to be misintepreted.
    All machine-learning methods suffers from the possibility of overgneralizing.
